psh-rpn+
-- RPN calculator in pure sh /with float support/
---- successor to postsh
---
Caveats
-- auto variable replacement
---- in sh $(()) can auto replace variables without needing a $
---- I've implemented this in rpn+ too however
---- variable discovery works fine unless executed within fish shell
-- psh-fractional
---- psh-fractional is still WIP
---- most functions work >70% of the time
---- but errors are still possible and are likely
---- additionally remember that sh has a max number of 2^(63-1)
